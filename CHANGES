= 3.0.0 / 2014-03-14

  * Moved Object#grammar to citrus/core_ext.rb. Citrus no longer installs core
    extensions by default. Use "require 'citrus/core_ext.rb'" instead of
    "require 'citrus'" to keep the previous behavior.

= 2.5.0 / 2014-03-13

  * Inputs may be generated from many different sources, including Pathname and
    IO objects (thanks blambeau).

  * Matches keep track of their offset in the original source  (thanks
    blambeau).

  * Citrus.load no longer raises Citrus::LoadError for files that can't be found
    or are not readable. Users must rescue Errno::ENOENT instead, for example.

  * Removed a few ruby warnings (thanks tbuehlmann)

= 2.4.1 / 2011-11-04

  * Fixed a bug that prevented rule names from starting with "super".

  * Several minor bug fixes.

= 2.4.0 / 2011-05-11

  * Fixed a bug that prevented parsing nested blocks correctly (issue #21).

  * Added URI example.

  * Moved example grammars inside lib/citrus/grammars and added
    lib/citrus/grammars.rb for easily requiring Citrus example grammars.

= 2.3.7 / 2011-02-20

  * Fixed a bug that prevented forward slashes from being used inside character
    class literals.

  * Added email address example.

= 2.3.6 / 2011-02-19

  * Fixed a bug that prevented memoization from advancing the input's pointer
    properly (thanks joachimm).

  * Several additions to the TextMate bundle (thanks joachimm).

= 2.3.5 / 2011-02-07

  * Fixed a bug that prevented Match objects from being printed properly using
    Kernel#puts (thanks joachimm).

  * Fixed a bug that prevented using rules with names that begin with "end"
    (thanks Mark Wilden).

  * Citrus#require accepts relative file paths, in addition to absolute ones.

  * Simplified/cleaned up some example files.

= 2.3.4 / 2011-01-17

  * Added CHANGES file.

= 2.3.3 / 2011-01-17

  * Added self to Match#captures hash. This means that a Match may retrieve a
    reference to itself by using its own label, proxy name, or index 0 in the
    hash.

  * Match#captures returns an empty array for unknown Symbol keys, coerces
    String keys to Symbols, and returns nil for unknown Numeric keys.

  * Moved Citrus::VERSION to its own file.

  * Citrus::LoadError is raised when Citrus is unable to load a file from the
    file system because it cannot be found or it is not readable.

  * Citrus::SyntaxError is raised when Citrus::File is unable to parse some
    Citrus syntax.

  * Added Citrus.require for requiring .citrus grammar files in a similar way
    to Ruby's Kernel.require. Also, overloaded the require operator in Citrus
    grammar files to failover to Citrus.require when Kernel.require raises a
    LoadError.

  * Improved UTF-8 support.

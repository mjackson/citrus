  * Added CHANGES file.

= 2.3.3 / 2011-01-17

  * Added self to Match#captures hash. This means that a Match may retrieve a
    reference to itself by using its own label, proxy name, or index 0 in the
    hash.

  * Match#captures returns an empty array for unknown Symbol keys, coerces
    String keys to Symbols, and returns nil for unknown Numeric keys.

  * Moved Citrus::VERSION to its own file.

  * Citrus::LoadError is raised when Citrus is unable to load a file from the
    file system because it cannot be found or it is not readable.

  * Citrus::SyntaxError is raised when Citrus::File is unable to parse some
    Citrus syntax.

  * Added Citrus.require for requiring .citrus grammar files in a similar way
    to Ruby's Kernel.require. Also, overloaded the require operator in Citrus
    grammar files to failover to Citrus.require when Kernel.require raises a
    LoadError.

  * Improved UTF-8 support.
